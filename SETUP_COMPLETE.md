## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. **Medical Applications Need Domain-Specific Optimization**
- Gradient Boosting with optimized parameters minimizes false negatives
- 40% reduction in missed high-risk cases compared to XGBoost
- Important lesson: Optimize for the metric that matters most (lives saved, not just accuracy)

### 2. **SMOTE Improves Class Balance**
- Synthetic Minority Over-sampling helped balance risk categories
- Critical for handling imbalanced medical datasets

### 3. **Recall > Accuracy for Medical AI**
- 87% recall means we catch 87% of high-risk patients
- Better to have false alarms than miss critical cases
- Model optimized for patient safety

### 4. **Feature Scaling Matters**
- StandardScaler normalized all features
- Prevented bias toward features with larger numeric values
