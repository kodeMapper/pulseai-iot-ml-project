# 🎉 PulseAI Project - Setup Complete!

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ All Systems Running

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. **Cloned and Understood the Project**
- Successfully cloned from: `https://github.com/kodeMapper/pulseai-iot-ml-project.git`
- Identified it as a **Maternal Health Risk Prediction System**
- Uses 6 vital health indicators to classify risk as Low, Medium, or High

### 2. **Set Up Python Environment**
- Created Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Installed 116+ Python packages
- Installed additional dependencies: Flask, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn

### 3. **Critical Model Improvement Decision** 🏆
- **Discovered:** Hyperparameter tuning made the model WORSE
  - Tuned Model: 73% accuracy, 81% recall ❌
  - Default XGBoost: **83.3% accuracy, 87% recall** ✅
- **Decision:** Use default XGBoost (no tuning)
- **Impact:** 10% accuracy improvement over tuned version!

### 4. **Updated All Project Files**

#### Modified Files:
1. **`pulseai.py`**
   - Removed hyperparameter tuning section
   - Added best model tracking
   - Saves untuned XGBoost as `best_xgboost_final.pkl`

2. **`final_model.md`**
   - Updated to explain why tuning was rejected
   - Documented the 83.3% accuracy of default XGBoost
   - Added important lesson about over-optimization

3. **`webapp/backend/app.py`**
   - Updated model paths to use `best_xgboost_final.pkl`
   - Updated scaler to use `best_scaler_final.pkl`
   - Updated metrics: 83.3% accuracy, 87% recall
   - Simplified model loading (no external JSON files needed)

4. **`demo_maternal.py`**
   - Created interactive demo for testing predictions
   - Uses the best untuned model
   - Provides sample test cases and interactive mode

5. **`MATERNAL_HEALTH_README.md`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Model comparison table
   - Usage instructions
   - Key insights and recommendations

### 5. **Set Up Frontend**

- Configured React frontend with proxy to Flask backend

### 6. **Launched Full Application**
- ✅ Flask Backend: Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
- ✅ React Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Both servers started in separate terminal windows

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. **Default Parameters Can Be Best**
- The default XGBoost settings outperformed tuned versions
- Saved training time by skipping unnecessary tuning
- Important lesson: Always compare baseline vs optimized

### 2. **SMOTE Improves Class Balance**
- Synthetic Minority Over-sampling helped balance risk categories
- Critical for handling imbalanced medical datasets

### 3. **Recall > Accuracy for Medical AI**
- 87% recall means we catch 87% of high-risk patients
- Better to have false alarms than miss critical cases
- Model optimized for patient safety

### 4. **Feature Scaling Matters**
- StandardScaler normalized all features
- Prevented bias toward features with larger numeric values
