## 📈 Key Findings

✅ **What Worked**:
- Data augmentation (+10% impact)
- Tree-based ensembles (consistent 51-53%)
- Proper evaluation (199 test samples vs 11)

❌ **What Didn't Work**:
- Feature engineering (0% impact, curse of dimensionality)
- Deep learning (-2% impact, dataset too small)
- Hyperparameter optimization (-1% impact, at performance ceiling)

## 🎯 Per-Class Performance (Best Model)

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Low Risk** | 77% | 39% | 52% | 69 |
| **Medium Risk** | 43% | 82% | 56% | 68 |
| **High Risk** | 67% | 35% | 46% | 62 |

**Problem**: Model biased toward Medium Risk, struggles with Low and High Risk classes.

## 💡 Next Steps

### Critical
1. **Collect more real data** (need 500-1000 samples)
2. **Consult domain experts** for feature relevance

### If continuing with current data
3. Focus on class imbalance (Low/High risk)
4. Simplify features (try 5-15 instead of 30)
5. Calibrate probability thresholds
