**Outcome**: UNSUCCESSFUL (underperformed)

### What Was Done
1. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
   - Architecture: 128‚Üí64‚Üí32‚Üí16‚Üí3 neurons
   - Regularization: Dropout (0.2-0.3), L2 (0.001)
   - Batch normalization between layers
   - Result: **50.25% test accuracy**
   - Epochs: 35 (early stopping triggered)

2. **1D Convolutional Neural Network**
   - Architecture: Conv1D(64)‚ÜíConv1D(32)‚ÜíDense(64)‚Üí32‚Üí3
   - Regularization: Dropout (0.3-0.4), MaxPooling1D

- **Overfitting**: Despite dropout and regularization
- **Early stopping**: Models plateaued quickly

### Impact
- **Accuracy degradation**: -2.01% vs traditional ML

**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ  
**Outcome**: NO IMPROVEMENT (performance ceiling)

### What Was Done
1. **Bayesian Optimization with Optuna**
   - **50 trials per model** (TPE sampler)
   - Optimized 4 best models:
     - Extra Trees
     - LightGBM
     - Random Forest
     - CatBoost

2. **Hyperparameter Search Spaces**
   - **Extra Trees**: n_estimators (200-800), max_depth (10-40), min_samples_split (2-20), etc.
   - **LightGBM**: learning_rate (0.01-0.3), num_leaves (20-100), regularization (1e-8 to 10)
   - Comprehensive search across 7-10 parameters each

3. **Results**
   - **Extra Trees Optimized**: 51.76% test (52.79% CV)
   - **LightGBM Optimized**: 50.25% test (53.22% CV)
   - **Random Forest Optimized**: 50.25% test (52.58% CV)
   - **CatBoost Optimized**: 50.25% test (52.14% CV)

### Why Optimization Failed
- **CV improved** but **test accuracy decreased**
- **Overfitting to CV folds**
- **Performance ceiling reached** (~52-53%)
- **Fundamental limitation**: Dataset size, not hyperparameters

### Key Insight
Cannot optimize beyond data quality/quantity limits. Need more real samples, not better tuning.

### Impact
- **Accuracy change**: -1.00% (52.76% ‚Üí 51.76%)
- **Conclusion**: Unoptimized Extra Trees remains best
- **Learning**: Hyperparameter tuning has diminishing returns on small datasets

### Files Created

- `models/optimized_best_model.pkl`
- `models/optimized_scaler.pkl`
- `models/optimized_metadata.json`

### If Continuing with Current Data
3. **Class imbalance handling**
   - SMOTE variants (Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN)
   - Class-weighted loss functions
   - Threshold optimization per class

4. **Feature simplification**
   - Use only 5-15 most important features
   - Reduce curse of dimensionality
   - Try RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination)

5. **Problem reformulation**
   - Binary: High Risk vs Others (may be easier)
   - Ordinal regression instead of classification
   - Multi-output: predict each vital separately
