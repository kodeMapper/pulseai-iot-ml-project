## 🔬 Feature Engineering Techniques Used

### 1. Domain Knowledge
```python
# Medical thresholds based on clinical standards
Temp_Fever = Temperature > 37.5°C (medical standard)
ECG_Abnormal = ECG > 20 (domain-specific threshold)
```

### 2. Statistical Transformations
```python
Z-Score = (X - μ) / σ
Min-Max = (X - min) / (max - min)
Percentile = rank(X) / n × 100
```

### 3. Non-Linear Features
```python
Polynomial: X², X³, √X
Ratios: X/Y
Interactions: X × Y, X × Y × Z
```

### 4. Anomaly Detection
```python
IQR Method:
  Lower = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR
  Upper = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
  Outlier if X < Lower or X > Upper
```
